# README

## Project Description

- This project was intended to be a program that would simulate a user's experience when cycling through a set of flashcards. This program is intended to be accessed via the command line. This project is entirely in JS with emphasis on utilizing ES6 and TDD. 

## Functionality

- I was only able to complete part of Iteration 2, so I do not have a functioning program to share a screencap or gif of. 

## Successes/Challenges

- Since I don't have a functional program, it seems like Install/Setup instructions are not really applicable and that maybe my successes and challenges would be more appropriate. 

### Successes

- I was able to successfully use beforeEach in my test files to DRY up my code. 
- I was able to successfully use arrow functions in my test files to comply with ES6. 
- I was able to (I think...) successfully complete the Card, Turn, and Deck files and test them. 

### Challenges

- I still am not sure I understand what to test and how to test it, particularly with the introduction of a new (to me) assertion library. 
- I still struggle with properly accessing one class from another. 
- In terms of learning habits, I really struggled with asking for help on this project. I know that I would have gotten farther if I had called upon my support system, so that is something I need to revisit.
